after performing one action the room state changes, new description?

clothed/unclothed states
(can get dressed at the start, but if not this effects the game as you are unclothed)

makeup/noMakeup states

furbies can be taken from dresser, up to 5 until they are depleeted. each one is a different color when you pick it up.

when you open a door to next area, you are prompted with "do you want to leave the room y/n"
